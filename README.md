hii! u can call me jade or **muu**, preferred muu. (**they/them/it/elle**) 

I'm a minor. so sorry if i am sth *emotional* or **sensitive/dramatic**!! its not intencional, *be patient like i'm with you*, please. 

interact with care **ALWAYS for everyone**

i speak *spanish* & *english*!

**big** rpgs & novels visual fan (muu fan too if YOU DONT NOTICE, don't try to compete with me :-I)

mostly off-tab, afk or semi-afk, so whisper can help. always free cuddle with me! But if I already have dniuf, dniuparty or dni, **do not interact with me in any way unless you are from a party or a friend pls.**

I don't usually interact first, I am a little shy to talk to others in general, don't expect much from me in energy social haha.. o_o I like to sit and just watch from afar, I like ponywatching (no, i don't harass.)

I avoid and ignore what I don't like or hate, the people who are on my DNI or etc. I don't put hide unless things don't get serious or you really bother me.

If any attitude or thing about me bothers you, **hide me** and that's all what you have to do if is that the situation. Don't look for a fight or much less cause me stress or harm, don't be a **idiot**

**super dni okegom.** full dni & more info in my links
